    "'''Exceptions are runtime errors that occur while a program is executing. They can be caused by various factors such as invalid input, file not found, division by zero, etc. Exceptions are instances of classes that are derived from the built-in BaseException class. Examples of common exceptions include ValueError, TypeError, ZeroDivisionError, and FileNotFoundError.\n",
